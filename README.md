IM2073 Web Programming Mini Project 
A WebApp made using java servlets and tomcat server. HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap were used to improve on the frontend. Coded JSP instead of normal static HTML pages to contain dynamic information. Used MySQL as database with sql statements injectedd into the backend servlets.
